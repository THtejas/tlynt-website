            <h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: July 26, 2022</p>
            <p>
              Thank you for using TLYNT! The TLYNT Platform (as further defined
              below) is a casting platform that allows advertisers
              <strong>(“Advertisers”)</strong> and real people talent
              <strong>(“Talent”)</strong> to connect, enables Advertisers to
              post and book Talent for advertising campaigns (each, a
              <strong>“Campaign”</strong>), and facilitates payment for work
              completed on Campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms of Use (this <strong>“Agreement”</strong>) constitute
              a binding legal agreement between yourself
              <strong>(“you”)</strong> and TLYNT Inc., a Delaware corporation
              <strong>(“TLYNT”, “we”, or “us”)</strong>, and govern your use of
              all websites, applications, services and offerings associated with
              the website joinTLYNT.com, (collectively, the
              <strong>“TLYNT Platform”</strong>). You and TLYNT may be
              individually referred to herein as a <strong>“Party”</strong> or
              collectively as the <strong>“Parties.”</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              BY USING THE TLYNT PLATFORM, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
              THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS
              AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE TLYNT PLATFORM.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >SECTION 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
                AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. WITH LIMITED
                EXCEPTIONS, DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND TLYNT WILL BE
                RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO
                OPT-OUT OF THAT REQUIREMENT.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE TLYNT PLATFORM
              AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE
              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF
              LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR
              ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN US AND YOU AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS
              OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
              THE TLYNT PLATFORM TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
            </p>
            <p>
              TLYNT may change any of the terms of this Agreement at any time,
              in TLYNT’s sole discretion. Please check periodically for updates
              to this Agreement so you are aware of any changes. We will notify
              you of any changes to this Agreement that materially modify your
              rights or obligations
              <strong>(“Material Modifications”)</strong> by e-mail to the
              address provided in your Account (as defined below) or by posting
              a notice to the TLYNT Platform. Any Material Modifications will be
              effective upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement, or upon
              your continued use of the TLYNT Platform after we send or post a
              notice of the changes, whichever is earlier. Changes to this
              Agreement that do not materially modify your rights or obligations
              will be effective immediately upon publication. However, any
              Disputes (as defined below) arising under this Agreement will be
              resolved pursuant to the version of this Agreement in effect at
              the time the Dispute arose. If any future changes to this
              Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in
              compliance with this Agreement, you must deactivate your Account,
              and immediately stop using the TLYNT Platform.

                    years or older to register an Account and access and use the

                    age of 2majority in the jurisdiction in which they reside
                    <strong>(“Minors”)</strong> may create an Account and
                    utilize the TLYNT Platform on behalf of Minors (collectively
                    referred to as
                    <strong>“Authorized Representatives”</strong>). For clarity,
                    if you are an Authorized Representative, the terms of this
                    Agreement (including all obligations and potential
                    liabilities) apply to you and the references to “you” herein
                    refer to the Authorized Representative and/or the Minor, as
                    context requires.

                    <strong>“Account”</strong>) using a stand-alone registration
                    or, if expressly authorized by TLYNT, a social media or
                    other login. You agree to create your Account on your own
                    behalf and not create accounts for anyone other than
                    yourself (unless, for clarity, you are the Authorized
                    Representative for a Minor).

                    The TLYNT Platform provides a venue where Advertisers can
                    book you for Campaigns. As the provider of the TLYNT
                    Platform, TLYNT does not control, offer or manage any
                    Campaigns. You may enter into a contract for the Campaign
                    directly with the Advertiser (such contract, the
                    <strong>“Campaign Contract”</strong>). TLYNT will have no
                    role in negotiating any Campaign Contract. TLYNT is not a
                    party to any contract entered into between you and any
                    Advertiser, nor is TLYNT a talent agency or employer. In
                    addition to this Agreement, you may be subject to, and
                    responsible for complying with, all terms of the Campaign

                <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving
                    Disputes between you and TLYNT in the most expedient and
                    cost effective manner, you and TLYNT agree that every
                    Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration, or as
                    otherwise provided in this Section 15.
                    <strong>“Dispute”</strong> means each and every dispute,
                    including any dispute, action or other controversy, whether
                    based on past, present or future events, between you and
                    TLYNT arising out of or relating to the TLYNT Platform or
                    the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, warranty,
                    statute, regulation, or another legal or equitable basis,
                    regardless of whether such dispute, action or other
                    controversy arises during or after the termination of this
                    Agreement, except for disputes relating to the enforcement
                    of TLYNT’s intellectual property. Arbitration is less formal
                    than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses an arbitrator
                    instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
                    discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
                    review by courts. The arbitrator will decide all issues
                    regarding the arbitrability of a Dispute, including the
                    scope of matters to be arbitrated and any alleged waiver or

                    <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Despite the provisions of
                    Section 15.1, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to
                    waive, preclude, or otherwise limit any right of either
                    party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims
                    court; or (b) pursue an action to enforce arbitration
                    through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if
                    that action is available.

                    <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and
                    TLYNT will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and
                    governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
                    <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) of the American Arbitration
                    Association <strong>(“AAA”)</strong>, as modified by this
                    Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA
                    Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org,
                    by calling the AAA at

                    Notice; Process. In the event of a Dispute, you or TLYNT
                    must send to the other party a written notice of the Dispute
                    to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal
                    Express (signature required) or, only if such other party
                    has not provided a current physical address, then by
                    electronic mail (“Dispute Notice”). TLYNT’s address for
                    Dispute Notice is:
                    <div class="address">
                      2046 Hillhurst Ave, Suite 14 <br />
                      Los Angeles, CA 90027
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      The Dispute Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis
                      of the Dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief
                      sought. The Parties will make good faith efforts to
                      resolve the Dispute directly, but if the Parties do not
                      reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the
                      Dispute Notice is received, you or TLYNT may commence an
                      arbitration proceeding or suit in small claims court.
                      During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
                      made by you or TLYNT must not be disclosed to the
                      arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
                      decision and award, if any.

                    <strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND TLYNT AGREE THAT
                    EACH OF YOU AND TLYNT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                    ONLY IN YOUR OR TLYNT’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
                    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY RELIEF MAY BE AWARDED ONLY
                    INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REDRESS
                    YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S); RELIEF MAY NOT BE AWARDED ON
                    BEHALF OF OTHERS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. Further, unless both
                    you and TLYNT agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                    consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
                    otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                    proceeding.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Enforceability.</strong> If one or more provisions
                    in this Section 15 are found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions
                    of this Section 15 and this Agreement generally will not be
                    impaired thereby, except that if a finding of partial
                    illegality or unenforceability would allow class or
                    representative arbitration, this Section 15 will be
                    unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a
                    non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request
                    a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks
                    authority to redress or award according to Section 15, then
                    only that respective claim or request for relief may be
                    brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of
                    any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending
                    the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for
                    relief in arbitration.

                    <strong>Opt-out.</strong> You may opt-out of the mutual
                    agreement to arbitrate Disputes provided in this Section 15
                    if you deliver notice to us within sixty (60) days of
                    initially agreeing to this Agreement. To opt-out, send a
                    written request containing your name, address, phone number,

                    <a href="mailto:support@jointlynt.com">support@jointlynt.com.</a> If
                    you opt-out, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be
                    null and void and, in that case, the Parties agree that the
                    exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18.6
                    below will govern any action arising out of or related to
                    this Agreement. However, if you agreed to a previous version
                    of this Agreement that allowed you to opt out of
                    arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out
                    remains binding.

                    <strong>Filing Period.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                    PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY DISPUTE MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1)
                    YEAR IN AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
                    The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to
                    the Dispute first occur. If a claim is not submitted within
                    one year, it is permanently barred. This period can only be
                    extended by the written consent of both Parties. No statutes
                    or provisions of law that would toll or otherwise affect the
                    time in which a party may bring a claim shall operate to
                    extend the period limited in this Section, and any such
                    statutes and provisions are hereby waived, to the fullest
                    extent permitted by law.

                    its rights and obligations under this Agreement, including
                    to an affiliated entity or in connection with a sale of
                    assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy,
                    other transaction, or by operation of law. You may not
                    assign any of your rights or delegate any of your
                    obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily,
                    involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise. Any
                    purported assignment or delegation in violation of this
                    Section will be null and void. This Agreement is binding
                    upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their
                    respective permitted successors and assigns.

                    <strong>Equitable Relief.</strong> Each party acknowledges
                    and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by you of
                    Section 2.4 would cause TLYNT irreparable harm for which
                    monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees
                    that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach,
                    TLYNT will be entitled to equitable relief, including a
                    restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and
                    any other relief that may be available from any court,
                    without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or
                    to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an
                    adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in
                    addition to all other remedies that may be available at law,
                    in equity, or otherwise.

                    <strong>Survival.</strong> The provisions in this Agreement
                    that must survive the expiration or termination of this
                    Agreement in order to give effect to their intent and
                    meaning will so survive. In addition, and without limiting
                    the generality of the preceding sentence, the following
                    Sections shall survive the expiration or termination of this

                  How is TLYNT different from other casting platforms currently
                  available?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  TLYNT is an app that connects advertisers directly with
                  real-people talent. TLYNT will better serve both talent and
                  advertisers through technology, artificial intelligence, and a
                  modern, user-friendly interface that feels more like a dating
                  app than a casting platform.

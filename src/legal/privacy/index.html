                  How is TLYNT different from other casting platforms currently
                  available?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  TLYNT is an app that connects advertisers directly with
                  real-people talent. TLYNT will better serve both talent and
                  advertisers through technology, artificial intelligence, and a
                  modern, user-friendly interface that feels more like a dating
                  app than a casting platform.
